		<h2>Why's a Jan?</h2>
		<p>Janathan was not made on a whim. Though their species is full of both artists and scientists alike, the idea of creating a wholly living and thinking species not of their own was outlandish. Still, in the mind of their creator, Tran was a worthy cause. With a small likeminded group, the project began, and Jan's sole purpose, to become as human as possible, began with it.</p></div>

		<h2>Who's a Jan?</h2>
		<p>I am! Hi! I have been on Earth for a little over fourish years now and I think it's incredible! I don't quite have a human body yet, but they're working to fix that! I have fancied the arts as many humans seem to do and in my creating I feel all the more real! I'm excited to continue and see all Earth has to offer.</p></div>

		<h2>How's a Jan?</h2>
		<p>I'm good! The plan isn't as secret as it used to be, obviously, but right now I have a metal shell around my body. I actually don't even have a face yet! Every now and then they come around and add more organs to my insides and wait until they stabilize to do it again. Soon I'll have skin, and teeth, I'll be able to eat, the whole nine yards! Eventually, the only non-organic thing about me will be my brain, but aren't humans all software up there anyway?</p></div>
